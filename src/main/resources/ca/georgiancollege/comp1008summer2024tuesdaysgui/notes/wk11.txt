JavaFX
GUI
	Graphical User Interface
		not console app
Organized using MVC

MVC like a restaurant
Dining Room		view
Waiter/Waitress		controller
Kitchen/Bar		model



Model: .java file. Normal,Concrete classes
with NO main method. Contain screen logic. Processes a request made by Controller

View: .fxml: like html but java version. has same syntax but different element names. elements are called Nodes

Controller: the liason between view and model. handles events


JavaFX can be compared to html/web
Web				JavaFX
Window				Stage
	browser
Document			Scene
	code inside body
Elements			Node
	tags
Events
	events
	window			initialze
	mouse			MouseEvent
	keyboard		KeyboardEvent


Containers
	Can contain other nodes
	First Contain = Root Node
	Outlines how the rest of the Nodes
	will be placed

AnchorPane: Nodes can be anchored. Contraints can be placed. Good for re-sizing layout

BorderPane: outlines 5 spots: top, bottom, left, center, right. Omit a spot. Each spot has 1 child Container

Pane: a general contain equivalent to DIV

GridPane: Tabular data: rows and columns

ScrollPane: A pane with scrollbars
SplitPane: a pane split either horizontally or vertically. Divider is visible
VBox: VerticalBox. All Nodes stacked vertically
HBox: All nodes horizontally stacked
TabPane: Tabs with Panes








Non-Containers
